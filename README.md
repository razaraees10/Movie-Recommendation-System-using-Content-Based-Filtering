# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Content-Based-Filtering
This project implements a movie recommendation system using content-based
filtering techniques. It analyzes movie metadata such as genres and keywords to
compute similarities between movies. The system utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to
represent movie descriptions as numerical features and calculates cosine
similarity scores between movies.
Based on the user's input movie, the system recommends a list of similar
movies, allowing users to discover new movies based on their preferences.
